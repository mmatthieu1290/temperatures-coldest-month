In this project, I analyzed the temperatures of three cities with a Mediterranean climate: Santiago and Curicó in Central Chile, and Perpignan in the south of France. 
I collected hourly temperature data for each city—specifically, for Perpignan during January 2024 and 2025, and for Santiago and Curicó during July 2023 and 2024. 
The analysis shows that Curicó is the coldest overall, Santiago experiences lower minimum temperatures than Perpignan, 
but also higher maximum temperatures.
